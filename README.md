PeerAssigner
============

The fastest, quickest and dirtiest way of assigning students for peer reviews that I could write (in Java). Maybe I'll improve it in the future.

How to Use
----------

Expects a Students.csv file (";" separation) with two columns: surnames and names.

Produces a Reviews.txt file with a list of the assignments.
